Purpose:
This example implements Power Management Unit (PMU) on LPC11xx

Note:Tested on Keil MCB1000 

Running mode:
* Build and debug the program.
* P1_4 is configured as wake up button

Notes:
The LPC11xx support a variety of power control features. In Active mode, when the chip
is running, power and clocks to selected peripherals can be optimized for power
consumption. In addition, there are four special modes of processor power reduction with
different peripherals running: Sleep mode, Deep-sleep mode, Power-down mode, and
Deep power-down mode. This example allows the user to put the device into various modes by editing the pmu.h header file.

Description:

** This example puts the LPC11xx part to Sleep,Deep Sleep or Deep Powerdown mode. Power modes can be configured in pmu.h file.
When TEST_POWERDOWN is enabled, the part is put to Deep Powerdown mode and all LEDs are found to be switched OFF on reset (peripherals).
To wake up, press P1_4 button on the board and P2_0 is found to be toggling continuosly.

** When TEST_POWERDOWN is not enabled, the user can configure the part to Sleep or Deep Sleep mode based on the flags set in pmu.h.
To wake up, pin PIO1.0 is to be pulled down.
