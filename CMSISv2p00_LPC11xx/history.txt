History of updates to CMSISv2p00_LPC11xx
========================================

22 February 2012
---------------
Updated version of LPC11xx.h with latest received from NXP with
version... '$Id:: LPC11xx.h 9198 2012-02-22 01:04:53Z usb00175',
containing update to LPC11xx_TMR and NMISRC register (SYSCON) 
for LPC11 Gen3 parts.

4 January 2012
--------------
Updated version of LPC11xx.h with latest received from NXP with
version... '$Id:: LPC11xx.h 8860 2011-12-22 23:12:34Z usb00175'

Note in particular that this new header no longer includes the
'SYSTICKCLKDIV' register in the  'LPC_SYSCON' peripheral. This
register had been erroneously included in previous versions as
a carry over from LPC13xx. In the LPC11xx family, the SysTick
timer is clocked from the CPU clock or from the reference clock,
which is fixed to half the frequency of the CPU clock.

Updated version of core_cm0.h from ARM (V2.03, dated
23. May 2011) - with main change being removal of
