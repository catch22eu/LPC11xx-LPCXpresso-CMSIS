Purpose:
To implement CAN APIs on LPC11Cxx

Note:Tested on Keil MCB1000 (LPC11C14) and LPCXpresso LPC11C24 with EA baseboard

Running mode:
* Build and debug

Description:
This project has CAN APIs to implement CAN_send, receive,process message and CAN IRQ handlers.
The user can configure the target 11Cxx into the following modes

TRANSMIT_ONLY           
POLLING                 
LOOPBACK_MODE           
BASIC_MODE
 
If none of the modes are chosen, RX_TX_Bouncing mode is selected by default.

In the RX_TX bouncing mode, use the CAN traffic analyzer
  or CAN message generator(e.g. PCAN Viewer or CANalyzer) on a 
  PC workstation to send messages to LPC11Cxx, once the firmware 
  receives the matching message, it will send a corresponding message 
  back to the PC.

CAN Settings-
