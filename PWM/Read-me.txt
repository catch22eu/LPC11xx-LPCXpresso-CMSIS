Purpose:
This example implements Pulse Width Modulation Test modules on LPC11xx

Note:Tested on LPCXpresso LPC1114 with EA baseboard

Running mode:
* Build and debug

Notes:
Utilizing the PWM on LPC11xx, a specified GPIO bit (LED) is switched ON/OFF.
The duty cycle can be controlled as desired.

Output:
Observe PWM signals on 
*CT32B_1 MAT 0/PIO1_1 with Freq 12KHz Duty cycle 75%.
*CT16B_0 MAT 1/PIO1_10 Freq 12KHz Duty cycle 50%.
*PIO2_0 toggles continuosly.

Specs:
PWM frequency used = 48KHz
