
This sample project serves as a simple demonstration to use
the built-in on-chip CAN drivers available on the LPC11C00
NXP microcontroller series.

Note:Tested on Keil MCB1000 (LPC11C14) and LPCXpresso LPC11C24 with EA baseboard

Hardware Requirements:
An external CAN Analyzer/Generator is needed to send and
receive CAN frames to the LPC11C00.

CAN Configuration:
CAN bus baudrate: 125kbps

Sample Project Details:

1.	Upon reset, the LPC11C00 will send a simple CAN frame
	using the on-chip CAN drivers. It will send a CAN frame
	with its data contents of "TEST".

2.	Whenever the LPC11C00 receives a CAN frame whose ID is
	between 0x400-0x4FF, it will simply resend the received
	frame back onto the CAN bus.

3.	While the LPC11C00 isn't sending or receiving CAN frames
	it will go into SLEEP. It resumes automatically into
	active mode once it has received a CAN frame.

4.	CAUTION! CAUTION! CAUTION! CAUTION! CAUTION! CAUTION!
	=====================================================
	Make sure to reserve memory from 0x1000 0050 - 0x1000 00B8
	for the on_chip CAN drivers!
	See the project's Target Options and the LPC11C1x Usermanual
	for details.
